The Ancient Tome is a glowing book that's dropped by raiders (barbarians, pirates, vikings, egyptian raiders, etc) during raids. The Ancient Tome cannot be crafted and is only available as a drop.

## Using the Gates

There are two uses for the Ancient Tome, one use for the player and one for the [Enchanter](../../source/workers/enchanter). The player's use is that if you have the Ancient Tome in your inventory, it will glow when there is going to be a raid that night. The Enchanter's use is to use the experience they collect from other workers to turn the Ancient Tome into a Book of Enchantment. When they do this, it will use up the Ancient Tome.
